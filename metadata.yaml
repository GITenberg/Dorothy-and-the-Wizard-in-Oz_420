description: "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz is the fourth book set in the Land of Oz\
  \ written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by John R. Neill. It was published on\
  \ June 18, 1908 and reunites Dorothy with the humbug Wizard from The Wonderful Wizard\
  \ of Oz (1900). This is one of only two of the original fourteen Oz books (the other\
  \ being The Emerald City of Oz (1910), to be illustrated with watercolor paintings.\n\
  Baum, having resigned himself to writing a series of Oz books, set up elements of\
  \ this book in the prior Ozma of Oz (1907). He was not entirely pleased with this,\
  \ as the introduction to Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz opens with the protest that\
  \ he knows many tales of many lands, and hoped that children would permit him to\
  \ tell them those tales.\nWritten shortly after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake\
  \ and around the time Baum moved to California, the book starts with an earthquake\
  \ in California. Dorothy and others are swallowed up by cracks in the earth, and\
  \ fall into an underground cavern, where they begin their adventures.\nVery little\
  \ of the story—six of the twenty chapters—actually takes place in Oz. As in Ozma\
  \ of Oz before it, and in some of the books after, Oz is not the land where the\
  \ adventures take place, but the land the characters are seeking as a refuge from\
  \ adventure.\nThe book was dedicated to Harriet Alvena Baum Neal, the author's eldest\
  \ sister.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
